# Experiments with 'story with maps' libraries

I am looking for a way to show images from a few different trips.  My goal is to find a format that shows the images well, but ties them to locations on the map for context.

Here are some basic examples that I have put together based on default templates:

* Italy - storymap.js  http://fawcett.github.io/italymap/storymapjs/index.html
* Italy - odyssey.js (scroll template)  http://fawcett.github.io/italymap/odyssey-scroll/odyssey.html
* Italy - odyssey.js (slide template)  http://fawcett.github.io/italymap/odyssey-slides/odyssey.html
